Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, as measured by population within city limits. Simultaneously, the city is one of the States of Germany. Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, and Brandenburg's capital Potsdam is nearby. Berlin's urban area has a population of around 4.5 million and is therefore the most populous urban area in Germany. The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region, and the sixth-biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.Berlin was built along the banks of the Spree river, which flows into the Havel in the western borough of Spandau. The city incorporates lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, the largest of which is M\u00fcggelsee. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks and gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes.First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin was designated the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417\u20131701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701\u20131918), German Empire (1871\u20131918), Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933), and Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic, and philosophical hub during the Age of Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and the German revolutions of 1848\u20131849. During the Gr\u00fcnderzeit, an industrialization-induced economic boom triggered a rapid population increase in Berlin. 1920s Berlin was the third-largest city in the world by population.After World War II and following Berlin's occupation, the city was split into West Berlin and East Berlin, divided by the Berlin Wall. East Berlin was declared the capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\nThe economy of Berlin is based on high tech and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, and media corporations. Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a complex public transportation network. Tourism in Berlin make the city a popular global destination. Significant industries include information technology, the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, the automotive industry, and electronics.\nBerlin is home to several universities such as the Humboldt University of Berlin, the Technical University of Berlin, and the Free University of Berlin. The Berlin Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe. Babelsberg Studio is the world's first large-scale movie studio complex and the list of films set in Berlin is long.Berlin is also home to three World Heritage Sites. Museum Island, the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin, and the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates. Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, and the Berlin Wall Memorial. Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, and libraries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nBerlin lies in northeastern Germany. Most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear Slavic languages-derived names. Typical Germanization for place name suffixes of Slavic origin are -ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch and -in, prefixes are Windisch and Wendisch. The name Berlin has its roots in the language of the West Slavs, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- (\"swamp\").Of Berlin's twelve boroughs, five bear a Slavic-derived name: Pankow, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-K\u00f6penick, and Spandau. Of Berlin's ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a Slavic-derived name: Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, K\u00f6penick, Lankwitz, L\u00fcbars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schm\u00f6ckwitz, Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4142, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e61be631-c988-4020-92fe-24690a00a7b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e61be631-c988-4020-92fe-24690a00a7b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e815614d-71ef-4130-b809-ff24d0a3c82b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "9093e9dbfecb9013bf4e9ebcab0ce8aa645380309975c0c53d9f74c778b8ded5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1b6cc5b-7a55-44ba-9ce2-4af01af7b002", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "6527faa96ed36467be190fadf5043862976a38a74deb996764736e175eda8e17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f915fd8-2d90-4e40-952a-7cce0145a281", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e82ceddfcd8d6c1324976db31af6d6f45d8e0d18f5fdb8855a13146572de4ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Prehistory of Berlin ===\nThe earliest human settlements in the area of modern Berlin are dated around 60,000 BC. In 2,000 BC dense human settlements along the Spree and Havel rivers gave rise to the Lausitzer Kultur.\n\n\n=== 12th century to 16th century ===\nEarly evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated 1270 to 1290, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and K\u00f6penick in 1209. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes, one was known as Via Imperii, and the other trade route reached from Bruges to Novgorod. In 1307 the two towns formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.Members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-C\u00f6lln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the \"Berlin Indignation\" (\"Berliner Unwille\"). Officially, the Berlin-C\u00f6lln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power. Berlin-C\u00f6lln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic League city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran.\n\n\n=== 17th to 19th centuries ===\nThe Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population. Frederick William, known as the \"Great Elector\", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration. Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.\nSince 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom, replacing K\u00f6nigsberg. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of C\u00f6lln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, \"Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin\".In 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740\u20131786), came to power. Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army. Following France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg.The Industrial Revolution transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire. In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.\n\n\n=== 20th to 21st centuries ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement. In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building.

In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in Vienna, and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through architecture. Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into World Capital Germania; these were never implemented.NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were deported to ghettos like \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and to concentration and extermination camps such as Auschwitz.Berlin hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics for which the Olympic stadium was built.\nDuring World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943\u201345 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed. After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to Allied-occupied Germany the sectors of the Allies of World War II (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet Union formed East Berlin.\nAll four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed the Berlin Blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949. In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist\u2013Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.\n\nThe founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions.

Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the city experienced significant urban development and still impacts urban planning decisions.\n Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first \"all Berlin\" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin. On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified Berlin (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.\n\nBerlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.In 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin.Construction of the \u201cBerlin Wall Trail\u201d (Berliner Mauerweg) began in 2002 and was completed in 2006.\nIn a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.In 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in Berlin with demonstrations of solidarity against racism, in response to the emergence of far-right politics in Germany.Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November. Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER's Terminal 5, the former Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year.

It became Germany's currently most expensive cultural project.\n\n\n=== Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt ===\n\nThe legal basis for a combined state of Berlin and Brandenburg is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the Basic Law stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law. However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.In 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg. Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there are over 225.000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to Berlin. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches. Though Berlin voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former West Berlin, Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on Berlin's large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nBerlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The Berliner Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Gro\u00dfer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Gro\u00dfer M\u00fcggelsee in eastern Berlin.Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg, and Neuk\u00f6lln lie on the Teltow Plateau.\nThe borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War. The M\u00fcggelberge at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.", "start_char_idx": 15450, "end_char_idx": 19079, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "513517e4-5963-4193-9966-0e7b9a8ce92b": {"__data__": {"id_": "513517e4-5963-4193-9966-0e7b9a8ce92b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e815614d-71ef-4130-b809-ff24d0a3c82b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "9093e9dbfecb9013bf4e9ebcab0ce8aa645380309975c0c53d9f74c778b8ded5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b3f7436-0575-4040-afb6-1d99935e2fe5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "1acb341ce67824ecb73612d9f45585953d7356d1dbf600cc0bcbaa858a3975b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06eff4b9-0e98-4e92-98b6-f9654dcc4229", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54797005b07632f2b699fb08fcb1a01cd4b3f3a0d4fff9c639e1a7916515a4e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Climate ===\nBerlin has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb). This type of climate features mild to very warm summer temperatures and cold, though not very severe, winters. Annual precipitation is modest.\nFrosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22\u201325 \u00b0C (72\u201377 \u00b0F) and lows of 12\u201314 \u00b0C (54\u201357 \u00b0F). Winters are cold with average high temperatures of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) and lows of \u22122 to 0 \u00b0C (28 to 32 \u00b0F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement. Temperatures can be 4 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas. Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March. The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) and the coldest was January 1709, with a mean temperature of \u221213.2 \u00b0C (8.2 \u00b0F). The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1 in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039 in) of rainfall.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nBerlin's history has left the city with a polycentric metropolitan area and an eclectic mix of architecture. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by German history during the 20th century.\nDevastated by the bombing of Berlin in World War II many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. After the reunification, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed, including the Forum Fridericianum along with, the Berlin State Opera, Charlottenburg Palace, Gendarmenmarkt, Alte Kommandantur, as well as the City Palace.\nThe list of tallest buildings in Berlin spreads across the urban area, they can be found for example at Potsdamer Platz, the City West, and Alexanderplatz.\nOver one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands, and water. Berlin's second-largest and most popular park, the Gro\u00dfer Tiergarten, is located right in the center of the city.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Fernsehturm (TV tower) at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368 m (1,207 ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin.  The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons, personifications of the four main Prussian rivers, and Neptune on top of it.\nThe Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\nThe East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\nThe Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the Franz\u00f6sischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the Stadtschloss continues. Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is Berlin Cathedral, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. St. Hedwig's Cathedral is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.\n\nUnter den Linden is a tree-lined east\u2013west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of Humboldt University is there. Friedrichstra\u00dfe was Berlin's legendary street during the Golden Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.\nPotsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down. To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berliner Philharmonie. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.The area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche H\u00f6fe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture.\nThe Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegess\u00e4ule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\nThe Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg, where John F. Kennedy made his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\" speech, is in Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg.\nWest of the center, Bellevue Palace is the residence of the German President. Charlottenburg Palace, which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\nThe Funkturm Berlin is a 150-meter-tall (490 ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\nThe Oberbaumbr\u00fccke over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 Berlin U-Bahn line. The bridge was completed in a brick gothic style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the Red Army from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a checkpoint and border crossing between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin.", "start_char_idx": 22579, "end_char_idx": 26751, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a56d7bb7-edc9-4438-ba17-dec1f22ca5dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "a56d7bb7-edc9-4438-ba17-dec1f22ca5dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e815614d-71ef-4130-b809-ff24d0a3c82b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "9093e9dbfecb9013bf4e9ebcab0ce8aa645380309975c0c53d9f74c778b8ded5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06eff4b9-0e98-4e92-98b6-f9654dcc4229", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "9ad38538ec6b0025c1a100fe2bff6b02716fbe80a0f2b26f24ee8e2b37326253", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cd4cc6c-9d95-47d4-bb87-62d0ce9def3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59f3ce360e6a112a6870c6f48ade8ee366d321ffd38e3bd6b77ce6a4cef55b48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\nThe Oberbaumbr\u00fccke over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg.

Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75 million registered inhabitants in an area of 891.1 km2 (344.1 sq mi). The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km2. Berlin is the most populous city proper in the European Union. In 2019, the urban area of Berlin had about 4.5 million inhabitants. As of 2019, the functional urban area was home to about 5.2 million people. The entire Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has a population of more than 6 million in an area of 30,546 km2 (11,794 sq mi).\nIn 2014, the city-state Berlin had 37,368 live births (+6.6%), a record number since 1991. The number of deaths was 32,314. Almost 2.0 million households were counted in the city. 54 percent of them were single-person households. More than 337,000 families with children under the age of 18 lived in Berlin.

In 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.\nActive immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community. The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions. A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel. Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.In December 2019 there were 777,345 registered residents of foreign nationality and another 542,975 German citizens with a \"migration background\" (Migrationshintergrund, MH), meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955. Foreign residents of Berlin originate from about 190 countries. 48 percent of the residents under the age of 15 have a migration background in 2017. Berlin in 2009 was estimated to have 100,000 to 250,000 unregistered inhabitants. Boroughs of Berlin with a significant number of migrants or foreign born population are Mitte, Neuk\u00f6lln and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. The number of Arabic speakers in Berlin could be higher than 150,000. There are at least 40,000 Berliners with Syrian citizenship, third only behind Turkish and Polish citizens. The 2015 refugee crisis made Berlin Europe's capital of Arab culture. Berlin is among the cities in Germany that have received the biggest amount of refugees after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of November 2022, an estimated 85,000 Ukrainian refugees were registered in Berlin, making Berlin the most popular destination of Ukrainian refugees in Germany.Berlin has a vibrant expatriate community involving precarious immigrants, illegal immigrants, seasonal workers, and refugees. Therefore, Berlin sustains a broad variety of English-based speakers. Speaking a particular type of English does attract prestige and cultural capital in Berlin.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission.\nBerlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Brandenburgish variant. The dialect is now seen more like a sociolect, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak standard German in everyday life.\nThe most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.", "start_char_idx": 27962, "end_char_idx": 31749, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfd1b4d4-6cb8-4d39-9bcd-e914bfe32d8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfd1b4d4-6cb8-4d39-9bcd-e914bfe32d8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e815614d-71ef-4130-b809-ff24d0a3c82b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "9093e9dbfecb9013bf4e9ebcab0ce8aa645380309975c0c53d9f74c778b8ded5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cd4cc6c-9d95-47d4-bb87-62d0ce9def3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "d48b5d2b125b49949da744da7fef7a03e20fe61325c06c34ba0f1613ce5049c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb54b310-c68d-4bb7-82c2-02c4d7db8efc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a3d9a5aff946ec4ffd547c3ca901265c4b68747dd1445847de67c23b3a7254a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Religion ===\n\nOn the report of the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.The largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the Protestant regional church body\u2014the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)\u2014a united church. EKBO is a member of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) and of the Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD (UEK). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the Roman Catholic Church had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members. About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly Eastern Orthodox, but also various Protestants). According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church. The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects church tax on behalf of the churches. It does not keep records of members of other religious organizations which may collect their own church tax, in this way.\nIn 2009, approximately 249,000 Muslims were reported by the Office of Statistics to be members of mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin, while in 2016, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed Ramadan in Berlin. In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Between 1992 and 2011 the Muslim population almost doubled.About 0.9% of Berliners belong to other religions. Of the estimated population of 30,000\u201345,000 Jewish residents, approximately 12,000 are registered members of religious organizations.Berlin is the seat of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Berlin and EKBO's elected chairperson is titled the bishop of EKBO. Furthermore, Berlin is the seat of many Orthodox cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptist, one of the two seats of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Western and Central Europe, and the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral of the Diocese of Berlin (Patriarchate of Moscow).\nThe faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many places of worship in Berlin. The Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church has eight parishes of different sizes in Berlin. There are 36 Baptist congregations (within Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany), 29 New Apostolic Churches, 15 United Methodist churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four Churches of Christ, Scientist (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Old Catholic church, and an Anglican church in Berlin.

The Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin (House of Representatives) functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the Senate of Berlin (Senat von Berlin). The Senate consists of the Governing Mayor of Berlin (Regierender B\u00fcrgermeister), and up to ten senators holding ministerial positions, two of them holding the title of \"Mayor\" (B\u00fcrgermeister) as deputy to the Governing Mayor.The total annual budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded \u20ac24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of \u20ac205 ($240) million. The German Federal city state of Berlin owns extensive assets, including administrative and government buildings, real estate companies, as well as stakes in the Olympic Stadium, swimming pools, housing companies, and numerous public enterprises and subsidiary companies. The federal state of Berlin runs a real estate portal to advertise commercial spaces or land suitable for redevelopment.The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the 2001 state election and won another term in the 2006 state election. From the 2016 state election until the 2023 state election, there was a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party. Since April 2023, the government has been formed by a coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (Oberb\u00fcrgermeister der Stadt) and Minister President of the State of Berlin (Ministerpr\u00e4sident des Bundeslandes). The office of the Governing Mayor is in the Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Since 2023, this office has been held by Kai Wegner of the Christian Democrats. He is the first conservative mayor in Berlin in more than two decades.\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nBerlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (Bezirke). Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (Ortsteile), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called Kiez. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (Bezirksamt) consisting of five councilors (Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te) including the borough's mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister). The council is elected by the borough assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (Rat der B\u00fcrgermeister), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.\n\n\n=== City partnerships ===\n\nBerlin to this day maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.

Since 1989, the transport network has been developed extensively. However, it still contains early 20th century traits, such as the U1.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nBerlin is served by one commercial international airport: Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing Tegel Airport (TXL) and Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin. Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020. The planned initial capacity of around 27 million passengers per year is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport was located at the same site as the BER. Both airports together handled 29.5 million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin. Tegel Airport was a focus city for Lufthansa and Eurowings while Sch\u00f6nefeld served as an important destination for airlines like Germania, easyJet and Ryanair. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller Tempelhof Airport, which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park.\n\n\n== Rohrpost ==\n\nFrom 1865 to 1976, Berlin operated an expansive pneumatic postal network, reaching a maximum length of 400 kilometers (roughly 250 miles) by 1940.

Conversely, the East Berlin system, which incorporated the Hauptelegraphenamt\u2014the central hub of the operation\u2014remained functional until 1976.\n\n\n== Energy ==\nBerlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm Vattenfall and the Berlin-based company GASAG. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern Brandenburg.As of 2015 the five largest power plants measured by capacity are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these power stations generate electricity and useful heat at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.\nIn 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban Autobahn, use overhead lines. The Berlin 380-kV electric line is the backbone of the city's energy grid.", "start_char_idx": 49701, "end_char_idx": 54177, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc7a65dc-482e-4930-a799-44f3b98d28a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc7a65dc-482e-4930-a799-44f3b98d28a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e815614d-71ef-4130-b809-ff24d0a3c82b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "9093e9dbfecb9013bf4e9ebcab0ce8aa645380309975c0c53d9f74c778b8ded5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0efac808-62a4-462e-9188-1f7abac4b3bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Berlin.txt", "file_name": "Berlin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76091, "creation_date": "2024-02-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-20", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-20"}, "hash": "dd51159357f5508c6e9f1282013f1eca4c855ad1b73d0a95019d84ac18b91cbe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7dc26ce-ec6e-4929-87d2-b46eb1c2a27a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9849dd02ec2cfd0ed941b713eeff167be6464d9ded562eadec118755bf7e1eee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Health ==\nBerlin has a long history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.
